# CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Welcome to the repository for **CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript**. This course, an advanced follow-up to CS50x, guides you through the building blocks of modern web development – from foundational design with HTML/CSS and Git to building full-stack applications with Python, Django, SQL, JavaScript, React, and beyond.

## Course Overview

Throughout this course, you will learn both front-end and back-end technologies essential for creating robust and scalable web applications. Real-world projects help you practice concepts like responsive design, database modeling, API usage, testing, and security, culminating in a capstone project where you design and deploy your own web application.
