    <body> 
        <h1 id="myHeader">Hello!</h1>
        <p>In this example, `header` is a constant that points to the h1 element on the page. 
            The text content of the header can be changed by pressing the button, 
            because we are not assigning a new value to the header constant, 
            but instead changing the `innerHTML` property. </p>
        <p>The key here is that while you can't reassign a new value to a constant after you've declared it, 
            if that constant holds an object (like an HTML element selected with querySelector), 
            you *can* change the properties *of* that object. 
            You're not assigning a new object to the constant, you're modifying the properties *within* that object.</p>
        <button id="myButton">Click me</button> 
        <script> 
            const header = document.querySelector('#myHeader'); 
            document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() { header.innerHTML = 'Goodbye!'; }); 
        </script>
